
Goal: We have created a Machine Learning Model,which will predict,whether the given texts are abussing or not.

The data was provided by Safecity India, which is a platform launched on 2012, that crowdsources personal stories of sexual harassment and abuse in public spaces.
They have collected over 10,000 stories from over 50 cities in India.

The dataset consists two .csv files with 12,122 sexual harassment cases within a chart with 9 columns that as a pandas DataFrame looks like.

The model code is provided in 'model.ipynb' file.
And the datasets are provided in this repository itself.


we implemented the model using Google colab.Just connect in that run all the cells then you can see the ouput of the model
in test case.


In test case you can type the text within """ """, to see what category that it falls under.
